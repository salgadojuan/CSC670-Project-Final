            <p>Deciding to take on the journey of a Computer Science (CS) student can be described as sailing into a vast ocean. With each wave of knowledge you will discover more about the 
                intricate world of computing, from the basic variable declaration to the advanced complexities of algorithms computer Science can be very intimidating. This journey started 
                with a "Intro to Cybersecurity Programming" class
                in my undergraduate program where I earned a B.Sc degree in Cybersecurity, it was a pivital experience that reshaped my understanding of programming and it's potential to 
                impact the world.
            </p>
                <p>I was never considered a tech savvy person, Nor did I have interest as a young kid to enter tech. My dream was to enter the military and become an airborne combat engineer
                    for the US Army, which I accomplished, and I had a great experience and such a fun job, but I realized that I couldn't do the job forever as it was already starting to take 
                    a toll on my body and I do not want to end up with major mobility issues in my lifetime due to the rigorous training of the job. So one day on my lunch break, I decided to look into other career's
                that alligned with my goals and to be honest I realized most jobs that peeked my interest were other rigourous careers like a Firefighter or a police officer and although very
                admireable careers, I knew deep down in my heart I wanted something different, so I shut down my laptop feeling somewhat overwhelmed because the 1st time in my life I did not know, 
                what I wanted to do, so I set goal that day that I will look for any "sign" to find a different type of career that I will at least enjoy enough to do daily, and also that I can do
                for a long time, we had annual trainings coming up that day which was always stressful for leadership as everyone had to set through powerpoints and a test on a computer what we learned
                it was always the same trainings so we never looked forward to them, but the attitude was always positive. </p>

                <p>After 3 lectures and tests the last training consisted of a Cybersecurity awareness module, I then knew I found my path because it was interesting that I can learn about cyber attacks and train others about them while making good money.
                    I then told myself "I found my Sign" and within the next year my contract for military service was almost up and I was presented the choice to re-enlist, I decided no and was going to attend
                    college to study Cybersecurity and I did. The program was the most diffucult experience for me I never came from a tech savvy background so the experience was extremely diffucult and to top it off,
                    my program was accerlated. I went through Covid-19, a life changing circumstance, and loss of close friends throughout my time studying and I somehow managed to get through it and graduate with honors for the 
                    first time in my life. I felt very proud of myself but I still felt like I did not know much about computing, sure I develped a baseline for certain technologies but I still felt like a novice, I then remembered
                    Intro to Cybersecurity Programming where we learned about Python to create a Cybersecurity tool and that was the class that I almost failed but because I did not, I felt that class was the most rewarding.
                    So I decided to look for a degree in Computer Science and long story short I almost went to a community college for an AS degree in computer sceince but I realized if I can pass some pre-requisite courses
                    I can join my schools MS program in computer science, so the fist class was Intro the programming with C++ which was the most intimidating but best decision I ever made in my academic journey.
                   
                </p>

                <p> Intro to programming in C++ was an extremely difficult class it was over a year since I programmed anything and I was far from being competitive in programming, but I was just happy to be there
                    and thinking to myself how my plan is starting to work out. I quickly realized that I needed extra practice than most students or at least it felt that way, so I jumped on Codecademy and gave myself the 
                    extra pracitce in C++, I did not understand concepts like what an array is and how its used in a real program but it helped just being exposed to the syntax (spelling) of C++. We went over declaring variables, loops, functions,
                    and object oriented programming just to name a few lessons, but the main concern is no one really told me the amount of hours I had to spend just studying then applying what I studied with actually coding, it was so much work.
                    Daily I would read the lessons, look at examples of code to understand the flow of how the program ran, then have to recreate the same lesson on my IDE, which is screen we code in. I felt very succesful when I would receive a graded assignment 
                    and its because when I went into the program I had a deep acceptance or understanding that I can fail because I had little experience with programming and I was not the best with math, so when the A grade came in, it only reenforced to keep 
                    my momentum going and to handle each problem as piece by piece to achieve a goal, that is probably the best and most underated lesson that I learned about being a computer science student, is that problem solving is a skill we develop with time
                    and experience, and I know it is true with life and coding. So if you are interested in programming try a free platform like Scrimba to learn web development, or Codecademy to learn any language you want, but do not let the fear of inexperience 
                    hold you back you will gain experience by actually programming and solving programming problems. Click on the images below to learn more about HTML, CSS, & javaScript. Thank you for reading my blog!
